      <p>
        For this university project I was given the task of redesigning Kiehl's
        brand identity, including everything from the logo, the colours and the
        imagery to the packaging, media and merchandising.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose to design a more modern and bold logo, compared to the previous
        handwritten logo, to appeal to a younger audience. The rebranding also
        used a pride-inspired colour palette to distinguish different product
        categories, which was used in the packaging and the advertising for the
        brand. I also chose to make a very personal approach, including real
        people in the posters and adding imagery related to each product,
        conveying a feeling of freshness and cleanliness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main focus in this project was not only designing all the elements
        that make up a brand's identity but also being capable of presenting the
        proposal in a well-written design manual with a good layout.
      </p>
      <p>
        This brand manual had to include previous research, explanations about
        the use of the typography, colours, logo, layouts and imagery for the
        printed media as well as all the final designs and real-life
        applications. These included stationary, printed media, brand clothing,
        vehicle floats and merchandising as well as the packaging designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall this project was challenging due to the amount of work that went
        into perfecting the brand manual, however I feel I gained a lot from
        working on it and it ignited a passion in me for brand identity design.

      <p>
        In this class project I had to create a wine brand name and the labels
        for white, red and rosé wine. I chose the name "Tiney Winey" as I wanted
        it to be a wine aimed at younger audiences, between 18-30 years old. The
        name stems from the expression: "I'll just have a tiney glass of wine"
        which is something I find people tend to say, before drinking about
        three glasses. This is what then inspired my copy: "A tiny winey...or
        three", referring as well to the three types of wine.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used a combination of pink and red for the red wine, yellow and blue
        for the white wine and pink and blue for the rosé. In addition to this,
        I decided to use bold and impactful imagery to appeal to the target
        audience. I also implied a visual metaphor of a tiney glass of wine,
        relating it to the brand name.
