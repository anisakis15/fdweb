        Hi! My name is Anisa Rodr√≠guez and I am a multidisciplinary graphic
        designer currently studying at UDIT. My work blends creativity with
        strategy, focusing on creating bold and engaging design solutions.
        Whether it's packaging and brand identity, designing posters for
        campaigns, working as a creative director or even painting, I believe
        art and design are meant to leave an impression.

        This portfolio is a recollection of my work so far, a reflection of my
        growth and a project I intend to keep working on, as there is always
        room for improvement. I'm always open to new collaborations, challenges,
        and opportunities to grow through design. So take a look at my work, I'm
        excited to share it with you!
