    <div class="content-text">
      <p>
        For my project "BIKERS", I designed a prototype of the interface of a
        small online bicycle store using Figma. I chose a color palette of red,
        black, and white, to evoke energy and action as well as contrast and
        clarity. These colors not only emphasize CTAs and buttons but also
        contribute to an overall clean and user-friendly design. The layout
        includes fixed elements such as the help bar, header, and navigation bar
        for easier access across the site. Icons for the cart, user profile, and
        search are intuitive, guiding users smoothly through the shopping
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typography was chosen with readability and hierarchy in mind: "LEMON
        MILK" for bold titles and CTAs, and Louis George Café for body text and
        navigation, ensuring clarity and legibility. Buttons are clearly
        labeled, center-aligned, and visually prominent to encourage action. The
        imagery, which was AI-generated with my own prompts to ensure stylistic
        consistency, depicts bikes and accessories in motion, helping users
        visualize the products clearly. The shopping cart overlay guides the
        user toward completing the purchase with a prominent CTA, reinforcing
        the purchase flow with thoughtful visual hierarchy.

      <p>
        Another prototype I created using Figma is ZONE OUT, a mobile app
        focused on providing a calm, intuitive, and supportive experience for
        users dealing with stress or anxiety. The app combines relaxation tools,
        like soothing videos, ASMR, and meditation content, with practical
        resources such as emergency contacts and support groups. A clean layout
        and smooth navigation help users access what they need quickly and
        comfortably, whether it’s to relax or seek help.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the visual design, I used a calming blue palette paired with white
        for clarity, while each content category is color-coded (turquoise for
        "Meditate," orange for "Funny") to reinforce emotional tone. I used soft
        gradients, AI-generated imagery, and a mix of serif and sans-serif
        typography to balance aesthetics with readability. Key features include
        large CTAs for cases of emergency, community support access, and a
        breathing animation during emergency calls to help users stay grounded.
