        "666" is a 3-minute long fashion film I directed, produced, and edited
        for my Audiovisual Communication final project.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept for this film was based on creating a blend of fashion and
        makeup and an eerie or even creepy aesthetic, inspired by demons and
        angels. I took care of the production by holding a casting for models,
        finding a stylist to help me come up with the outfits, contacting a
        videographer, and arranging the place and time of filming. I was also in
        charge of creative direction and the makeup. Lastly, I took care of the
        editing, making sure my vision came to life exactly as I had imagined
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project has marked a before and after in my work and sparked a
        passion in me for creative direction and production in the audiovisual
        world. Since then, I have also directed and produced a Videoclip, which
        has made me even more interested in working in this area.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the filming, I also acted as a photographer to take the stills
        for both the poster and the thumbnail for the video, as well as behind
        the scenes pictures. For my final presentation, I designed this poster,
        overlaying two images I had taken, creating movement and achieving a
        scary yet intriguing effect. Finally, I designed the logo for Angelic
        Productions.
